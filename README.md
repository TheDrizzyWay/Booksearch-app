# Booksearch-app
A simple app for finding books using the googlebooks api. Built with react, babel 7 and webpack 4. Layout designed with material ui.
The react-redux folder contains an implementation of the application using redux/redux-thunk for state management.
Pretty sure you can figure out what the other folder contains.
